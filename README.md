An epub is created from the url, then mailed to the kindle. Amazon converts that epub into azw3 for viewing on kindle.
So you can use send2kindle, even if you're using a different ereader like Kobo and Remarkable if it supports pushing ebooks via email.

</p>


__3. Multiple webpages combined in a single volume__

  <img width="100%" src="assets/send-link-file-new.svg">
</p>



__4. Send Multiple files at once__

You can send multiple files or links at once.

`send2kindle` auto detects the type of file and takes required action.


Each argument is sent as a separate file.


For example, the command below will send an html page (converted to ebook), an ebook and a collection of bookmarks post downloading the webpages and creating an ebook from them.


```sh
send2kindle send http://paulgraham.com/hwh.html jane-eyre-autobiography.epub some-links.txt
```



__5. Download but not send__

If you just want to save a webpage for reading later, replace `send` with `download` and the files will be saved in local directory but will not be sent to an ereader.

Example

```sh
send2kindle download https://blog.maxgio.me/posts/linux-scheduler-journey/
```

<p align="center">
  <img width="100%" src="assets/download-new.svg">
</p>



### Additional options

Default timeout for mail is 2 minutes, if you get timeout error while sending bigger files. Increase the timeout using `--mail-timeout <number of seconds>` or `-m` option



Specify a different configuration file using `--config` or `-c` option. Configuration is stored in home directory as `KindleConfig.json`. You can directly edit it if you want.


When sending a collection of pages if no title is provided, volume takes the title of the first page.

You can always get more information about usage of commands and options by typing `send2kindle help`
